# ShopSphere Cohort Analysis

**By Oluwamuyiwa Jaiyeola**

A data-driven look into customer retention and segmentation in the e-commerce space using cohort and RFM analysis.

---

## Overview
This project explores how customers engagement evolves after their first purchase - 
identifying who stays, who leaves, and why. Using the **ShopSphere** dataset, 
customers are grouped by their first purchase month and tracked over time through
a **Cohort Retention Heatmap** and **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** Analysis. This analysis
helps with the segmentation of the customers into different segments based on the purchase behaviour
and patterns.

---

## Key Insights
- **V-VIPs (Top Spenders):** Low recency, high loyalty - maintain with exclusivity.  
- **VIPs (Consistent Buyers):** High recency - use next-purchase incentives.  
- **Loyal Regulars:** Moderate activity - reward engagement to boost frequency.  
- **At-Risk/Lost:** High recency (inactive) - run reactivation campaigns.

## Tools Used
**Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Yellowbrick**, **Git**, **GitHub**
